# Code Camp Fall 2018

This repository contains all materials and code for tech@SOLES' Code Camp.

## Introduction

Code Camp is an extracurricular mini-course organized by SOLES@UCLA to accompany the course work of first quarter computer science and electrical engineering students. Topics covered include computer science basics, introductory software engineering skills, and tips for getting an internship or research opportunity. Each week we will explore a different topic to help first quarter students adjust to computer science at UCLA.
